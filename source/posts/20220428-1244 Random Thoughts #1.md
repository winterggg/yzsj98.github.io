## Feelings

- A little **NERVOUS**, but more **EXCITED** (at least for now) for the upcoming job hunting journey (WITH ONLY TWO MONTHS LEFT).

- I **FEAR** that my lack of confidence will affect my performance.

- I am getting **TIRED** with interview prep and seems to be hitting a snag with LeetCode.

- **Concerned** about my relationship with Ms. Xiao, our recent communication has been limited to a horrible "早安" and a desperate "晚安".

- I find it hard to quit coffee. Right now, I'm enjoying a can of Red Bull while feeling terrible and regretful.

- I feel less productive these days.

## Answers

- What tweaks should I make in my interview prep? --> Sleep more! Exercise more! Summarize more!

- How to solve the self-confidence issue? --> No solution. But perhaps I can work on my presentation skills.(such as 礼物心态，PEEP rule).

- How to get rid of boredom? --> Extend the scope of my daily learning. Act fast and without hesitation.

- What should I say about the relationship? --> The difficulty is just temporary and is caused by things such as covid and stress. It will be OK once the current matter is settled.

- Is it truly necessary for me to give up coffee? --> Without a doubt, just one cup of coffee in the morning can cut my sleep by at least two hours that night. I'm thinking I should quickly drop all of my coffee.

- How to be more productive? --> I need to improve my time management strategy, therefore I'm going to attempt the time boxing method.
